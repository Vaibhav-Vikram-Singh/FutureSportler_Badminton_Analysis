# 🏸 Badminton Performance Analyzer – AI Engineer Task (Future Sportler)

This project was developed as part of the AI Engineer hiring process at **Future Sportler**.  
It analyzes badminton gameplay videos to extract **stroke mechanics**, **movement profiling**, **serve legality**, and **reaction timing** from a player's performance.

---

## 📌 Task Objective

To build a generalizable AI pipeline that:
- Processes badminton match videos
- Uses human pose estimation to track player movement
- Detects and evaluates shot execution, footwork, posture, and reaction latency
- Provides annotated video outputs with visual and textual feedback

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🎯 Pose estimation using **MediaPipe**
- 🏃‍♂️ Movement analysis (lunge, chasse, split-step)
- 🏸 Shot mechanics detection (smashes, clears, drops, etc.)
- ⏱ Reaction time measurement
- ⚠️ Serve legality detection (wrist, elbow, shoulder positioning)
- 🎥 Annotated output videos with overlaid insights
